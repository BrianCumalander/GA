    gave the answers in the question for testing purposes. Found out that I needed set up my RANK CONDITIONS to ask for highest points accumulated first, then less and less. AND, I couldn't use the OR || operators in the 
    ranking section, it would goof up--and I was confused. So instead of understandig the issue, I folded and used the teacher's answer which was to use  correct >= (number greater than the next ranking). --This method I understand.
